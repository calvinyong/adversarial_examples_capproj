# Adversarial Examples Capstone Project

![](meme.jpg)

## Background about myself

I did not know anything about neural networks (NN) or deep learning before this project. Couldn't write a simple network before fall. Beginning of this project consisted of me learning how to code up NNs.

## Intro

Welcome to the repo for my adversarial examples capstone project, for the Masters of Science in Mathematical Finance (MSMF) program.

For the report, see the jupyter notebook in the [Final_notebook](https://gitlab.com/calvinpyong/GANs-capstone-project/tree/master/Final_notebook) folder

11/12/18: Notebook is finished.
12/01/18: Moved from gitlab to github.

## Contents of Repo

Adversarial_Code: Small notebooks experimenting with attacks

Final_notebook: The report for this project

Practice_code: Notebooks of trying to implement basic NN architectures.

Sample_code: Code for building DNNs, mostly taken from Keras repo.

Vizualizations: Trying to visualize layers with adversarial inputs

## Notes

Notebooks were ran using a GeForce 980. CNN models were made using my university's P100.

Keras models used in this project can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xceMmw7CKhJ9mw8SkIbgCLNhH3JsdO-r/view?usp=sharing).

CIFAR10 code in Sample_code is from Keras github repo

Black-box attacks, or good luck getting gradients out of your self-driving car
